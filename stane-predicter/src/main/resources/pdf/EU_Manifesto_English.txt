In Plaid Cymru‚Äôs ‚ÄòPlan C - a plan to move the Welsh

improve the economy through better local
procurement and upskilling our workforce.

Plaid Cymru has worked to improve European
procurement legislation and public sector practice

businesses who support the supply chain by using
more Welsh companies and employees who spend
their money in their local high street.
In France and Germany around 98% of public

we can increase the value of Welsh public sector

with rebates for businesses with a rateable value
of up to ¬£15,000.
Plaid Cymru wants Wales to be a European and
world leader in green growth through ensuring
that we have the skills and research and
development to reduce our energy use, generate
renewable energy and reduce waste and

Plaid Cymru wants a greater focus on ensuring the

Plaid Cymru will continue to learn from
educational initiatives around Europe to

Bilingualism and multilingualism is the norm in
Europe. Evidence points to improved educational

Food, Agriculture & Rural Affairs
PLAID CYMRU RECOGNISES THE
IMPORTANCE OF FOOD PRODUCTION TO
OUR ECONOMY. WALES DEPENDS ON ITS
FARMERS AS FOOD PRODUCERS AND
MANAGERS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE.
We welcomed the continuation of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) which helps keep over
80% of Welsh farms in business with direct
payments.
Attempts by the previous and current UK
Governments to abolish these payments show how
the Welsh national interest is very different from
the UK interest. Of the four parties representing
Wales in Europe, only Plaid Cymru voted to protect
the CAP budget. Plaid Cymru is clearly on the side
of Welsh farmers.
Plaid Cymru worked with colleagues in other
nations to ensure that the agricultural reforms did
not penalise Welsh farmers who had already
adopted environmental programmes. We secured
to the new payment regime. While the results of
CAP reform are mixed, we avoided the disastrous
consequences that would have occurred if the UK
government succeeded in its aim of further
changes.

Plaid Cymru voted against cuts
in the EU budget because it
meant cuts to Welsh agriculture
funding. The farming
industry is crucial to our
economy and needs a
sustainable long term future.
We also opposed the Welsh Government‚Äôs decision
to transfer the maximum 15% from Pillar 1 to
Pillar 2 of CAP, an attack on Welsh farming at a
time when the industry has already seen a 44%
net drop in farm incomes.

Plaid Cymru has worked closely with the farming
community on issues such as the dairy package,
Development Plan and fallen stock. We will
continue to promote and protect our agricultural
industry.
The localisation of the food chain is essential to cut
down on food miles and un-necessary
transportation. That is why we support local farms
and local processing facilities, abattoirs, and food
markets so that people can buy food from local
suppliers and sources.
The horsemeat scandal highlighted the importance
of international regulation in protecting
consumers on an international level. Co-operation
led to agreements, an action plan and timeline to
deal with ‚Äòfood fraud‚Äô.
Plaid Cymru believes that the link between fresh
produce and food on the plate must be restored
and families should be supported by local
authorities to grow their own food in allotments
and gardens.
But buying good food depends on the consumer
knowing exactly what it contains. We have worked
to constantly improve food labelling and give
consumers real information and choice. It is
unacceptable to label food as healthy when it

Energy & Climate Change
ENERGY IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ALL
HOUSEHOLDS IN WALES.
Climate change cannot be tackled on a countryby-country basis. That is why Wales must work
with the European Union and other international

action on reducing man made climate change and
promoting decarbonisation.
Plaid Cymru wants all powers over energy

If Wales produces more of its own renewable
energy then we will be able to lessen our reliance
upon other forms of energy and electricity and
reduce our bills.
That is why we want greater community

production in their own areas.
We also want a Welsh national energy grid to

Plaid Cymru shares the widespread concerns
about the use of hydraulic fracturing to force shale
gas from the ground.
The environmental impacts of this process are
unknown, but could include the contamination
of the water table. It also means continuing our
dependency on fossil fuels. Exploiting this carbon
intensive form of energy will also undermine our
obligations to deliver on our national and
international carbon reduction targets to help

Plaid Cymru voted in favour of the European
Commission's proposal to extend the

Proposals for high speed internet through improved

We want a better connected Wales online so that

whether that is social interaction with family and

and for small businesses to compete internationally.
It is unfair on consumers, and on those living in
rural areas in particular, that communications
regulators allow mobile phone companies to
provide a slower service than in more populous
areas. This lack of connectivity is bad for business.
The European Union, on the other hand, has been
crucial in ensuring a fair deal for mobile phone
owners by slashing the exorbitant charges made for
cross-border telephone calls and data.
