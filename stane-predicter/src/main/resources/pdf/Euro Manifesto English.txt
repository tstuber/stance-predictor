4 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

FOR REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE,
VOTE CONSERVATIVE
We have a very clear message in these European elections:
if you want real change in Europe, vote Conservative.

Europe needs real change

Ultimately, reform of the EU is
not about new agreements and
communiqués, but new jobs and
new opportunities – new hope. It’s
about more young people knowing
the purpose and pride of going out
to work in the morning and getting
on in life.

Many people in Britain – including
me – feel strongly that the
European Union must change.

To regain people’s trust, the EU
must demonstrably help people
prosper.

I hear time and again from people
about their frustrations with the
EU: it is too bureaucratic and too
undemocratic. It interferes too
much in our daily lives, and the
scale of EU migration triggered
by new members joining in recent
years has had a huge impact on
local communities.

Our long-term economic plan seeking. And unlike any other party

The Conservatives are the only
party with a track record of
delivering change in Europe – and
the only party that can and will
hold an in-out referendum on
Britain’s membership of the EU.

– promising more wealth and more
work here in the UK. The prizes are
huge, if only the EU is dynamic and
flexible enough to go for them.
And now that we have a stronger
economy at home, we have
renewed respect abroad – to fight
for real change in Europe.

A record of delivering change
We know the changes we are

For young people who need
it to generate more jobs, for
communities facing pressures on
public services and housing, and
for businesses struggling with red
tape, the need for real change in
Europe is urgent.
I completely understand and
share these concerns. So do
many across Europe. We know
that if we are to succeed in an
intensely competitive world, where
countries in the South and East
are steadily growing in economic
power, the EU must become much
more competitive, or at least not
prevent Britain from becoming
more competitive. It is not ‘ever
closer union’ and ever more red
tape we need, but ever more
ways of creating new businesses,
trading and doing deals.

Changing Europe in this way is vital
to Britain’s long-term economic
plan. The Government I lead is
implementing a clear plan to turn
our economy around and give all
our people the best chance of
success. It is a plan to create more
jobs, give more hope to young
people and to give families across
Britain more financial security and
peace of mind.
Already the plan is working. Our
deficit is down, our economy is
growing, 1.3 million more people
are in work – that is 1.3 million
people who go to sleep at night
with the peace of mind of a regular
wage. We are one of the fastest
growing economies in Europe.
But we want to go further, create
more jobs and more opportunities
– and there is no doubt that a
reformed European Union can help
us with that. The EU’s own market
is the biggest and wealthiest on
the planet. We have 500 million
consumers on our doorstep. The
EU is currently trying to open up
trade with North America and Asia

standing in these elections, we
don’t just talk about “real change”
– we have delivered it.
I vetoed a treaty that was not in
Britain’s interests. We cut the
EU budget for the first time in its
history, saving British taxpayers
billions of pounds. Where Labour
weakly signed us up for Eurozone
bail-outs, we got Britain out. We
stood up to Europe on a financial
transactions tax that would have
hurt our economy. We protected our
rebate – whereas Labour gave £7
billion away.
None of these things were
inevitable. They happened because
Conservatives in Europe fight hard
for Britain’s interests. And that is
exactly what we will keep on doing
in the months and years to come.

Only Conservatives will
deliver an in-out referendum
The EU now plays a major role in
all our lives. That role has changed
dramatically since the 1975
referendum on our membership of
what was then just the Common

CONSERVATIVE PARTY EUROPEAN ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014 | 5

Market, the last time the British
people were given a say. It is a
fundamental principle for me that
membership of the European Union
depends on the consent of the
sovereign British people – and in
recent years that has worn wafer-thin.
That’s why, if I am Prime Minister
after the election, I will negotiate
a new settlement for Britain in
Europe, and then ask the British
people: do you wish to stay in the
EU on this basis, or leave? I will
hold that in-out referendum before

6 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

the end of 2017, and respect the
decision.
In contrast, Labour and the Liberal
Democrats won’t stand up for
Britain and they refuse to give
people a choice in a referendum.
UKIP offer no serious plan and
simply can’t deliver on anything
they promise.
So the choice at these elections
is clear: Labour and the Liberal
Democrats won’t give people a say.
UKIP can’t give people a say.

Only the Conservatives can deliver
real change in Europe – and only
the Conservatives can and will
deliver that in-out referendum.

DAVID CAMERON MP
Prime Minister and Leader
of the Conservative Party

CONSERVATIVE PRIORITIES
FOR EUROPE
Here are some of the key changes we will fight for:
●

Powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it, and cutting the cost of EU
administration.

●

National parliaments able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.

●

Businesses liberated from red tape and benefiting from the strength of the EU’s own
market – the biggest and wealthiest on the planet – to open up greater free trade
with North America and Asia.

●

Our police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered
by unnecessary interference from the European institutions, including the European
Court of Human Rights.

●

Free movement to take up work, not a freedom to move just for more generous
benefits.

●

Support for the continued enlargement of the EU to new members, but with new
mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the continent.

●

End our commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in the Treaty, to which
every EU country has to sign up. It may appeal to some countries. But it is not right
for Britain, and we must ensure we are no longer subject to it.

In other words, yes to the Single
Market. Yes to turbo-charging free
trade. Yes to working together
where we are stronger together
than alone, as we are doing today
on Ukraine. Yes to a family of
nations, all part of a European
Union – but whose interests,
crucially, are guaranteed whether
inside the Euro or out.

No to ‘ever closer union’. No to a
constant flow of power to Brussels.
No to unnecessary interference.
And no, of course, to the Euro, to
participation in Eurozone bail-outs
or notions like a European Army.
Crucially, the British people will
have a clear choice: to remain in
the European Union or to leave it.

Sovereignty must remain with the
British people through our own
democratic institutions.
The more Conservative MEPs
elected in May, the harder we will
be able to campaign for – and
deliver – our plan for change.

8 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

FOREWORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE
CONSERVATIVES IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
The British people want a better deal in the European Union and
they want the right to decide whether to stay in the EU or leave
altogether. Our Prime Minister, David Cameron, has made that
clear, and set out a plan to make it happen. It is a plan that
Conservative MEPs will do everything they can to deliver.
We have to face facts. Because
of the Treaties Labour signed
when they were in Government –
Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon – the
European Parliament today has real
power. It now jointly makes most EU
laws with the governments of the
28 countries that are members of
the EU. The Conservatives are the
only party with a plan, who will turn
up and fight for Britain’s interests.
Conservatives have a track record
that proves we can deliver for
Britain. People said we could never
cut the EU budget, but we did.
People said that we would never
get out of bailing out Eurozone
countries, but we did. People said
the EU could never change, that
we were stuck with the disastrous
Common Fisheries Policy and its
shameful practice of discarding
perfectly edible fish, but we
reformed it.
Our reforms are opening up huge
new opportunities for British
business. We have been at the

forefront of the effort to conclude
free trade deals with South Korea,
Canada and Singapore, and are
working towards deals with India,
Japan and the United States. We
have led a programme to cut EU red
tape and meddling in people’s lives.
So the people you elect on 22nd
May will make a difference.
If you want more EU red tape,
more interference from Brussels,
a bigger EU budget and no
referendum – vote Labour. They are
the ones who signed away power
after power to the EU and refused
to give the British people a vote,
and they are the ones who opened
the door for uncontrolled migration.
Both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats oppose our plan, won’t
stand up for Britain and refuse to
give the British people a say.
UKIP MEPs are happy to take the
salary and the expenses, but they
won’t turn up to vote to defend
Britain’s interests.

Conservatives have a plan: reform
of the way the European Union
works, renegotiation to bring
powers back to Britain and then a
historic referendum in which the
British people have their say for the
first time since 1975. I am asking
for your vote so we can put this
plan into action.
Britain needs people on the ground
fighting our corner in Brussels.
David Cameron has set out a clear
plan, and has behind him a strong
team of people who will work to
deliver it. If you want real change
in Europe, MEPs who stand up
for Britain’s interests, and the
right to decide on Britain’s future
in Europe in a referendum – vote
Conservative.

SYED KAMALL MEP
Leader of the Conservatives
in the European Parliament

REAL CHANGE: DELIVERING AN IN-OUT
REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN’S MEMBERSHIP OF
THE EU AND A NEW SETTLEMENT IN EUROPE
The British people now have a very
clear choice: if you want a referendum
on whether Britain should stay in the
EU or leave, only the Conservative
Party can and will hold one. Labour
and the Liberal Democrats don’t want
change and refuse to give people a
say, while UKIP simply cannot deliver.
We have a track record of real change

and delivery in Europe that no previous
Government has matched. We cut the
budget, reducing the cost of Europe to
British taxpayers. We vetoed a treaty
that was not in our national interest.
We withdrew British taxpayers from
obligations to bail out the Euro.
Conservatives now want to go
even further by negotiating a better

relationship with the EU. If we win the
next general election, we will give the
British people an in-out referendum on
Europe by the end of 2017.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats want
to deny the British people their right to
a referendum, while UKIP don’t have
the power to deliver one. It is only the
Conservatives who can deliver real change.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

We are the only one of the three main parties
to have committed formally to holding an in-out
referendum in the next Parliament.

●

Hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s EU
membership by the end of 2017, the first time the
British people will have had a say since 1975.

9

We have cut the EU budget for the first time, while
protecting Britain’s rebate, saving British taxpayers
£8.15 billion.

●

End Britain’s commitment to ‘ever closer union.’ It is
a political project that is not right for Britain, and we
must ensure we are no longer part of it.

9

We stopped British involvement in Eurozone
bailouts, thus securing the first ever return of power
from Brussels.

●

9
9

Make decisions for ourselves, working with our
European partners where it makes sense to do so
and support the establishment of a new principle in
the EU: ‘Europe if necessary, national when possible.’

We vetoed a treaty that wasn’t in Britain’s interests.
●

Ensure a bigger role for national governments in
setting the EU’s agenda.

●

Preserve the integrity of the Single Market by
insisting on protections for those countries that have
kept their own currencies.

●

Keep up the pressure for a single location for the
European Parliament, so that your taxes are not
wasted on maintaining two costly sets of official
buildings.

●

Continue the downward pressure on expenditure and
tougher scrutiny of the EU budget and accounts.

●

Strengthen the ‘yellow card’ power for national
parliaments and introduce a system of ‘red cards’ so
that national parliaments can group together to block
legislation that need not be agreed at the European
level and bring back democratic accountability over
EU decisions. We also support the Dutch Parliament’s
proposals for further increased national Parliamentary
control over EU legislation.

We ensured that key decisions on banking
union require Britain’s consent, protecting our
position in the single market and maintaining the
competitiveness of our world-leading financial
services industry.

9

Britain has taken the lead in exercising ‘yellow card’
powers, which bring back democratic accountability
over EU decisions by enabling national parliaments
to force the European Commission to reconsider
proposed new EU laws.

9

As pledged, the Conservative Party formed a new
group in the European Parliament – the European
Conservatives and Reformists – this means that for
the first time the European Parliament now has a
mainstream group dedicated to a Europe of nation
states, not a federal Europe.

REAL CHANGE: DELIVERING OUR LONG-TERM
ECONOMIC PLAN IN EUROPE
The Conservatives are the only party
with a long-term economic plan to
secure Britain’s future:
Reducing the deficit so we deal with our
debts, safeguard our economy for the
long-term and keep mortgage rates low.
Cutting income tax and freezing fuel
duty to help hardworking people be
more financially secure.
Creating more jobs by backing small
business and enterprise with better
infrastructure and lower jobs taxes.

Capping welfare and reducing
immigration so our economy delivers
for people who want to work hard and
play by the rules.

thousands of families who now have
decent jobs, better prospects, and
more security and peace of mind about
their children’s future.

Delivering the best schools and
skills for young people so the
next generation can succeed in a
competitive world.

To keep on with this plan, and keep
on delivering for the British people, we
need real change in Brussels. We need
real change to reward those who work
hard and play by the rules; to back our
businesses and create more decent
well-paying jobs; to get real value for
every single taxpayer’s penny that goes
to Europe. It is only the Conservatives
who can deliver that change.

This plan is already working. Our
economy is growing. The deficit is set
to halve. Debt is lower. More than 1.7
million private sector jobs have been
created since 2010. Hundreds of

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

We have cut the EU budget, for the first time in
history, and pushed for better value for money for
British taxpayers in all spending.

●

9

We have taken the lead in protecting small and
medium-sized firms by ensuring they will no longer
be subject to a raft of EU-wide legislation.

Continue to keep up the pressure for lower EU
spending, further reform the Common Agricultural
Policy and the EU’s Structural Funds and focus EU
spending on growth and jobs to get better value for
money for British taxpayers.

●

Further expand the Single Market both by breaking
down remaining barriers and ensuring that new
sectors are opened up to British firms.

●

Take further steps to reduce the burden of excessive
red tape on businesses by simplifying or withdrawing
more EU rules wherever possible, just as we have
done at home with our Red Tape Challenge and onein-two-out programme.

●

Deal with the damaging effects of the Working Time
Directive, in particular on our public services.

●

Drive forward the efforts to finalise ambitious free
trade deals with the United States, Japan and India
– which can win millions of jobs – and push for EUASEAN and Mexico free trade agreements and an
investment deal with China.

●

Create a real Digital Single Market so Britain’s
technology entrepreneurs in Tech City and beyond
can sell their market-beating products and services
across Europe.

●

Ensure that new rules target unscrupulous behaviour
in the financial services industry, while safeguarding
Britain as a global centre of excellence in banking,
and fend off attempts to restrict legitimate financial
services activities.

●

Enable more British students to benefit from the
popular Erasmus programme that allows students
to spend time at EU universities, at no extra cost to
them.

9
9

We have championed a European patent system
and secured a London-based European Patent
Court, which will generate up to £200 million a year
for the British economy.
We have stopped Britain being subject to an EU-wide
Financial Transactions Tax, which would have hurt
savings and pensions and lost British and European
jobs to the United States and Asia, and opposed
one size fits all European taxation.

9

We have increased transparency in the bidding for
European research funds, ensuring that Britain’s
first-class research institutions benefit by competing
on a level playing field.

9

We have prevented a European ban on stem cell
research, which would have undermined our ability
to find cures to the most terrible diseases and
damaged Britain’s life sciences industry.

9

We have been at the forefront of the effort to
conclude free trade deals with South Korea, Canada
and Singapore, which have opened up valuable
markets for British exporters.

9

We have led the charge on tax reform, tax transparency
and tax evasion around the world. We put it at the heart
of the G8 agenda and ensured that 44 countries have
now committed to early implementation of automatic
information exchange on tax matters.

REAL CHANGE: ON IMMIGRATION
The Conservative Party has always
believed in maintaining tight control
of Britain’s borders. Immigration has
contributed a great deal to Britain’s
society, economy and culture. But
uncontrolled immigration – such as we
saw under the last Labour Government
– makes it difficult to maintain social
cohesion, puts pressure on public
services, such as housing, and
can affect wages for people on low
incomes. We are clear that, under
Labour, immigration was far too high.
Net migration more than quadrupled
between 1997 and 2010, totalling
2.2 million people – equivalent to two

cities the size of Birmingham.
In government since 2010, we have
built an immigration system that
works in the national interest. Our
reforms have cut non-EU migration
to its lowest level since 1998. While
other countries have thrown open
their borders, the Conservative Party
has kept Britain out of the Schengen
open borders area. At the same time,
we are making sure that those who do
come here are the brightest and the
best, those who have the skills and
entrepreneurial talent to help create
jobs and growth.

We support free movement for workers
in Europe, which allows Britons to seek
jobs and gain customers across the
continent, but we need to stop benefit
tourism and abuse. One and a half
million British citizens live in other
EU countries, working there, living in
retirement or studying. And while we
welcome hardworking people from other
European countries, we will not accept
abuses of free movement, particularly
in the form of benefit tourism by people
who have no intention of working or
making a contribution to society. Other
EU countries are already taking steps to
deal with these issues.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

Kept out of the Schengen open borders area,
which allows citizens in mainland European Union
nations to travel across borders without having their
passports checked.

●

Press for a return to free movement of workers; free
movement is a central principle of the EU, but it
cannot be a freedom to move just for more generous
benefits.

9

We have toughened up rules on access to benefits
for people from other EU countries, clamping down
on benefit tourism and making it easier to expel
people who are not here to work and who cannot
support themselves.

●

Push for an end to a system where immigrants can
claim welfare payments for their relatives abroad;
free movement of workers should not be about
exporting child benefit, and we will work with our
European partners to address this.

9

We have further tightened up rules so that no one
can come to this country and expect to get out-ofwork benefits immediately.

●

9

We will not pay out of work benefits at all for the
first three months and only then after Englishlanguage assessments.

Change how free movement comes in for countries
joining the EU in the future so we do not see the level
of migrations we have had in the past: for example,
by requiring a new country to reach a certain income
or economic output per head before allowing full free
movement.

9

●

We no longer pay benefits indefinitely to EU
migrants; we changed the rules this year so we will
now be cutting benefits off after six months unless
migrants have a real prospect of employment.

Remain open to the best and brightest students from
around the world, but continue to remove licences
from bogus colleges, on top of the 700 already taken
away since 2011.

9

●

We are toughening up the test which migrants
who want to claim benefits must undergo – and if
they don’t pass that test, we will cut off access to
benefits. In addition, newly arrived EU jobseekers will
not be able to claim housing benefit. We will defend
this in the courts against Brussels.

Continue to prevent extremists and preachers of hate
from coming to Britain and spreading radicalism and
community discord.

9

We are cracking down on businesses which exploit
migrant workers by paying them less than the
minimum wage – fining them up to £20,000 for
every underpaid employee; more than four times the
previous fine.

9

If people are not here to work, but begging or
sleeping rough, they will be deported and barred
from re-entry for 12 months, unless they can prove
they have a job.

14 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

We will maintain tight control of
Britain’s borders, and not accept
abuses of free movement

CONSERVATIVE PARTY EUROPEAN ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014 | 15

REAL CHANGE: ON JUSTICE
The Conservative Party is the party of
law and order. We want to maintain
British control of our justice system.
We want to ensure that people feel
safe as they walk the streets and
safe in their homes at night – and few
things are more important than that.
We in the Conservative Party are
clear: we want the British Parliament
and devolved legislatures drawing
up our laws, British courts applying

those laws, and police forces deciding
how best to deal with crime. That’s
why we exercised the UK’s opt-out
from pre-Lisbon Treaty police and
criminal justice measures in Europe
and have made clear that we would
join in no EU police or criminal and
justice legislation without appropriate
Parliamentary scrutiny.
Of course, there are some areas
where it makes sense to maintain

practical co-operation at the
European level. In an age when
crime is increasingly mobile – when
gangs can operate across borders
– keeping our people safe must
mean working with other nations,
whether that is identifying criminals at
border crossings or deporting illegal
immigrants. We do not want an EU
criminal justice code; but we do want
practical co-operation that protects
our people from harm.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

We opted out of European control of large parts
of our justice system where it was unnecessarily
interfering in our national rules with little tangible
benefit for our citizens.

●

9

We have acted to address the flaws in the European
Arrest Warrant that the Labour Government ignored.
Our major reforms to how it works will make it a
proportionate and effective tool in fighting crime and
bringing those criminals to justice.

Undertake radical reform of human rights laws and
publish a detailed plan for reform that a Conservative
government would implement immediately: we will
scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act, curtail the role
of the European Court of Human Rights in the UK
and make certain that the UK’s Supreme Court is in
Britain and not in Strasbourg.

●

Press for further practical co-operation on tackling
terrorism, crime and illegal immigration.

●

Step up European co-operation in the fight against
modern slavery, female genital mutilation and forced
marriage.

●

If we opt back into the European Arrest Warrant, we
will build on our reforms to make sure that it is not
applicable for minor crimes; that alternatives can be
used where possible; that lengthy pre-trial detention
can be avoided; and that people are not extradited
for doing things that are not illegal in the UK.

●

Keep the UK out of harmonising measures on
criminal law, asylum, immigration and border control
that offer no benefit to Britain – including saying no to
a European Public Prosecutor’s Office.

9

Implemented the European Prisoner Transfer
Agreement, enabling the UK to send European
criminals back to their own country to serve out
their prison sentence.

9

Improved how information is exchanged between
police forces and national border controls, making
it easier to prevent criminals and illegal immigrants
entering the UK.

9

Helped introduce a European Protection Order so
that partners – usually women – who have suffered
domestic violence can rely on a restraining order
obtained in their home country, wherever they are in
the EU.

9

Used the UK’s opt out to keep Britain out of greater
EU control over asylum and immigration policy.

CONSERVATIVE PARTY EUROPEAN ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014 | 17

REAL CHANGE: ON ENERGY
The UK faces real and significant
challenges in the coming years,
not least on energy. We need to
secure energy at an affordable
price, cut carbon in order to help
prevent dangerous climate change,
and reduce our reliance on any one
technology or source of supply. Indeed,
developments in Ukraine have woken
Europe up to the importance of
diversifying its energy sources.

In meeting these challenges, the EU
has some important roles to play. For
instance, we support EU countries
agreeing an over-arching climate goal,
and using the Emissions Trading
Scheme to drive these reductions
across Europe at the lowest possible
cost. That is in all our interests – and
in the interests of generations to
come.

But it is also vital that we maintain
our energy sovereignty. For families
and businesses across Britain, energy
bills are a big slice of their budget –
and, in order to help drive down this
cost, we must have control of our own
energy mix. A secure supply of energy
is a fundamental duty of national
government and this should not be
jeopardised by EU agreements or
actions.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

Underpinned Europe’s climate ambitions by cutting
carbon at home. UK greenhouse gas emissions
in 2012 were 25% lower than in 1990 thanks to
Government action to decarbonise our power supply.

●

Ensure the EU completes the creation of a single
energy market across Europe, in order to ensure
greater energy security and lower prices for UK
consumers.

9

Unlocked new sources of low-carbon energy by:

●

Ensure that the EU Commission’s strategic review
of European energy security for the next 25 years is
implemented; this will further help us plan for the
UK’s energy future.

●

Work with European partners such as Poland to
develop fully Europe’s shale gas resource. We have
commissioned a joint taskforce which will report at
the end of the year.

– investing £1 billion capital spend on carbon,
capture and storage, which could save the UK
more than £30 billion a year by 2050.

●

9

Support an ambitious and equitable international
deal on climate change, including campaigning for EU
countries to cut emissions by at least 40% by 2030.

Improved our energy security by unlocking
investment in the UK North Sea, and by developing
UK shale gas.

●

9

Support and further reform the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme as the most cost-effective means for EU
countries to cut emissions.

Further enhanced our energy security by committing
to interconnecting the UK power network with
neighbouring countries.

Stopped EU attempts to ban further offshore oil and
gas drilling, following Commission proposals to overregulate this industry.

Ensure that the proposed 2030 renewable energy
target is non-binding on individual EU countries. In
order to cut carbon as cost-effectively as possible,
nuclear, carbon capture and renewables technologies
should be allowed to compete on a level playing field.

●

Stopped EU attempts to over-regulate the UK’s
emerging shale gas industry, which we have
supported by putting in place the most competitive
tax regime in Europe and a comprehensive package
for local communities – worth £1 million a year for a
typical site.

Work with European partners to ensure that each

REAL CHANGE: FOR FARMERS, FISHING
COMMUNITIES AND OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Britain’s farmers and fishing
communities play a vital role in our
national life and help sustain a rural
economy that is worth £211 billion a
year. These activities put food on our
tables, nurture our countryside and
form the heart of many communities.
For years, they were disadvantaged
by European policy – and for years
Conservatives have fought to change
that.
British farming has a well-deserved
and world-wide reputation for its top
quality produce, robust traceability
and rigorous production standards.
As the world’s population continues
to grow and tastes and diets develop,
we believe that there are phenomenal
opportunities to sell British food and

drink abroad. That’s why Conservatives
in Government have prioritised opening
up new markets to British producers.
Too often the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) puts British farms at a
disadvantage, burdening them with
unnecessary expense and red tape.
We are passionately committed to
reforming the CAP further, getting
a better deal for our farmers, and
allowing them to sell their top quality
produce all around the world.
We support rural communities. That’s
why we have made spending on flood
defences a major priority for this
Government, as well as creating a
special £10 million Farming Flood
Recovery Fund to help those affected

by the recent extreme weather. We have
also made it our mission to complete
the roll-out of superfast broadband, a
technology that can truly bridge the gap
between urban and rural.
The Common Fisheries Policy used
to be a disaster. We fought hard
for wholesale reform – and won.
Today, the micro-management from
Brussels is being reversed; the
appalling practice of edible fish
being thrown back into the sea to
meet a bureaucratic requirement is
being abolished; and we now have
a legally binding commitment to fish
at sustainable levels. All this means
that today, fishing communities from
the Highlands to Cornwall have more
security and peace of mind.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED:

WHAT WE WILL DO:

9

●

Push for continuing reform of the CAP so that it costs
less and offers better value for money.

●

Ensure that the new CAP reforms are implemented
and adhered to by all EU countries, so our farmers
are not unfairly disadvantaged.

●

Secure further export opportunities for British
farmers both in the EU and globally, and fight
to ensure that farming is included in free trade
agreements such as that with the USA.

●

Cut red tape to reduce the costs to all businesses by
at least £1 billion by 2019.

●

Ensure the ban on discarding perfectly edible
fish, along with the wider fisheries reforms are
implemented fully.

●

Build on this success to secure further reform and
give local people a bigger say in the future of the
fishing industry.

●

Work to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated
fishing.

Opened up 112 markets for animals and animal
products in the last year alone. For example, we
have:
– signed a deal on pork with the Chinese that has
contributed to £9 million of growth in the pork
market, in addition to £12 million of growth in
hides and skins;
– secured a deal on beef to Singapore worth up to
£10 million a year; and
– agreed a deal on animal genetic material with
China, which alongside live pig exports, is worth
up to £45 million over five years.

9
9

Helped British fishermen manage their own
businesses by stripping away the ineffective micromanagement by Brussels, allowing us to work with
our closest neighbours instead.
Pushed for radical reforms to the Common Fisheries
Policy, fought for tougher science-based targets to
ensure sustainable fishing and ended the shameful
policy of throwing back perfectly edible fish.

9

Reformed the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
which supports British fishing communities, while at
the same time ending subsidies that fund destructive
fishing practices.

●

Support the introduction of food labelling to give
consumers more information about where and how
our food is produced, while avoiding burdensome
rules for small firms.

9

We continue to champion the highest standards of
animal welfare and in Europe we have led the way by
pushing for tough legal action against countries who
have failed to adhere to the phased bans on battery
cages for chickens and sow stalls for pigs throughout
the EU.

●

Actively work to improve animal welfare standards
and ensure that rules are properly enforced
throughout the EU.

WHAT WE HAVE DELIVERED: continued

9

Improved the terms of the CAP and gained powers
for the countries of the EU on how to implement it,
leaving our farmers in a better position to compete
in the global marketplace.

9

Fought for a science-based Genetic Modification
policy in the EU to keep British farmers competitive,
get better value for British consumers and further
bolster the British biotechnology and life sciences
industries’ world-leading position.

9

Given our farmers the support they need to
compete:
– reduced the burden of form-filling on farmers, with
two domestic regulations being removed for every
one introduced and 8,000 fewer dairy inspections
a year since 2011;
– put in place the first Government Buying
Standards for food and catering services, which
ensure that government departments and
agencies buy more sustainable food and give
small and local producers fair access to public
contracts worth up to £2.1 billion a year;
– backed the Red Tractor scheme, which gives
consumers confidence in the food they buy and
which boosts British farming;
– taken steps to address weaknesses in our food
system revealed by the horsemeat scandal,
including by asking Professor Chris Elliott to lead a
rigorous, independent review;
– promoted the use of protected food names
which showcase British farming excellence, like
Anglesey Sea Salt, West Country Beef and Lamb,
Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese and Traditional
Farmed Gloucestershire Old Spots Pork;
– spent over £2.4 billion on flood defence
infrastructure in the first four years of this
Parliament, compared to the £2.2 billion spent in
the final four years of the last Parliament; and
– invested £790 million to extend superfast
broadband to 95% of the UK by 2017. This will be
match-funded by local authorities.

9

Set up the UK’s first Marine Protected Zones,
protecting 27 areas, covering over 9,000 square
kilometres, with a commitment to designate up to
100 further Zones over the next Parliament. 10% of
UK seas are now protected, and a quarter of English
inshore waters.

9

Launched a national tree planting campaign – The
Big Tree Plant – which has already seen 100,000
trees planted, and will plant a million by 2015.

22 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

WHAT WE WILL DO: continued
●

The historic six-year capital settlement secured from
2015/16 to 2020/21 means we will be investing a
further £2.3 billion in UK flood defences.

●

Invest £10 million in an innovative technology
market fund to test how superfast broadband can be
extended to the final 5% of the most rural areas.

REAL CHANGE: FOR A SECURE BRITAIN
Britain’s fortunes are tied to the wider
world. Terrorist plots hatched thousands
of miles away can threaten our streets.
Deals done in China or India can create
thousands of jobs back home. Conflict
in far-off countries can lead to mass
migration here. So tackling global
poverty, resolving conflict and spreading
democracy – in short, engaging with
the world – are resolutely in Britain’s
national interest.

can be an important means of
advancing our national interest by
shaping a more stable and prosperous
world. Together we have the clout to
influence our wider neighbourhood,
whether that is supporting economic
development in the South of Europe,
or helping countries to the East of the
EU – such as the Ukraine, Moldova
and Georgia – onto a more open,
democratic path.

EU policy must never be a replacement
for national decision-making and
national defence policy, and neither
should it duplicate or undermine the
work of NATO, which must remain the
bedrock of our security. Where EU
policy conflicts with our interests, or
undermines national sovereignty, we
act – as we did when we vetoed the
creation of an EU military headquarters.

We will continue to stand up robustly
for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity and the international rule of
law. We want to see a Ukraine that has
good relations with Russia but we also
believe it has as much right as any
other European country to determine
its own future.

they have had enough of the pervasive
corruption that has held their country

back. We will support them in their
efforts to build a true democracy in
which the law is applied fairly and fully
to all. The EU also has a crucial role
to play. We will continue to work with
our European partners so that the
EU works with the Ukrainian people
towards these goals.
Developments in Ukraine have been
clear proof of the risks of excessive
European energy dependence on
Russia. A long term goal for all
European countries should now be
greater energy independence and
security: that must be one of the long
term costs to the Russian Government
of its behaviour toward Ukraine.
For Conservatives in Brussels, Britain’s
national interest is always our first
priority: the safety of our citizens, and
the jobs and opportunities created
back home.

WHAT WE WILL DO:

Maintained Britain’s right to make its own decisions.

●

Protected NATO as the cornerstone of our security
and blocked attempts to duplicate defence
structures.

Continue to stand up robustly for Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the
international rule of law.

●

Led efforts for co-ordinated action at the European
level through co-operation between sovereign states
on the most serious international issues:

Ensure the rights of Gibraltarians are fully respected,
particularly regarding free movement, aviation and
maritime policy.

●

Ensure defence policy remains firmly under
British national control, maintaining NATO and the
transatlantic relationship as the cornerstones of our
defence and security policy.

●

Push for open markets to the benefit of British
defence industries, contributing to further economic
growth and jobs at home.

●

Continue to drive up the effectiveness of the EU’s
efforts to tackle poverty in the world’s poorest
countries, and ensure that the EU plays its part in
responding to humanitarian emergencies around the
world.

●

Continue to push at the EU level David Cameron’s
work through the UK G8 Presidency to clamp down
on tax avoidance, promote transparency in company
ownership, and root out corruption in extractive
industries.

– standing up to Russia over Ukraine;
– secured the toughest ever EU sanctions on Iran,
which has brought the Iranian government to the
negotiating table on its nuclear programme, the
best hope for peace in the region;
– successfully used EU sanctions to incentivise
the Burmese government to turn towards the
greater freedom and openness we now see in the
country;
– provided the headquarters for the EU anti-piracy
mission off Somalia that has helped see attacks
on shipping plummet;
– in Mali, we and our allies are helping to support
the establishment of an effective government in a
country that almost fell to terrorism; and
– we successfully championed greater EU trade
access for Pakistan, including lower tariffs which
provide crucial help for their economy.

We have strengthened our alliance with France by
signing the historic Lancaster House Treaties to
improve defence cooperation, including the creation
of a combined expeditionary force to carry out
joint operations, closer cooperation on equipment
procurement, and joint facilities to support our
independent nuclear deterrents.

In Libya, the United Kingdom led the international
diplomatic and military effort that prevented
Gaddafi’s regime from massacring his own people.

We have been the world’s second largest donor of
international aid to help the Syrian people in their
hour of need and we have played a leading role in
efforts to find a peaceful solution to this appalling
conflict.

9

In Sri Lanka, thanks to a UK-sponsored resolution
at the UN, for which we won the support of EU
and many other countries, we have successfully
secured an independent international investigation
into allegations of war crimes. That will be the best
possible basis for proper reconciliation and a better
future for the Sri Lankan people.

26 | REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE

WHAT WE WILL DO: continued
●

Increase opportunities for the poorest countries
to trade with the EU and each other by further
opening EU markets, reducing EU export subsidies
and negotiating generous Economic Partnership
Agreements.

●

Work for a greener environment, including steps to
cut carbon emissions across Europe and efforts to
limit global warming to 2 degrees.
