EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

Equal Civil Marriage: A Consultation Response by
Plaid Cymru – The Party of Wales

Question 1: Do you agree or disagree with enabling all couples, regardless of their
gender to have a civil marriage ceremony?
AGREE
Plaid Cymru supports the extension of civil marriage to all couples, regardless of their
gender, as a natural and necessary extension to the successful introduction of civil
partnerships in 2004. We therefore agree with the proposals as outlined in Equal
Civil Marriage: A Consultation that would enable same-sex couples to choose a civil
marriage ceremony.
However, Plaid Cymru advocates a more progressive approach to the proposals
currently under consultation, particularly with respect of removing the ban on faith
communities who actively wish to conduct religious same-sex marriages (see
question 5) and in extending the availability of civil partnerships to opposite-sex
couples (question 8). Nevertheless, the current proposals would represent a further
advance in the equality and equal rights of LGBT couples.
Plaid Cymru believes that equal civil marriage will further the development of a
confident, outward looking, free and prosperous Wales where all of our communities
play a full and active role in society.

Question 2: Please explain the reasons for your answer. Please respond within 1,225
characters (approx 200 words).
Plaid Cymru has consistently supported the passage of legislative measures that
would enhance the equality and equal rights of LGBT people, among them civil
partnerships in 2004, the repeal of section 28 in 2003, and equalisation of the age of
consent in 2000.
Although civil partnerships for same-sex couples represented a major advance that is
to be celebrated, LGBT people are still subject to prejudice, discrimination and
violence. Recent ACPO hate crime data reported a 17% increase in criminal violence
motivated by a personʼs sexual orientation in Wales1. While this disturbing
development may be an indication that LGBT individuals are increasingly willing to
report homophobic violence, it nevertheless suggests that more work is required to
eliminate prejudice and achieve equality in our communities.

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

Plaid Cymru proudly supported the introduction of civil partnerships. But with the
continued discrimination faced by LGBT individuals in society, Plaid Cymru believes
that the continued delineation of legal recognition of a coupleʼs commitment on the
basis of sexual orientation is no longer appropriate. Equal marriage will be an
important progression that will help bring an end to any lingering perception that
same-sex relations are somehow less valid or important as those between oppositesex couples.

Question 3: If you identify as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual would you
wish to have a civil marriage ceremony?
LGBT members of Plaid Cymruʼs LGBT affiliate group, Plaid Pride, are strongly
supportive of the option of choosing a civil marriage to declare and formalise their
love and commitment to their partners. Having consulted with our LGBT members
through Plaid Pride, and consistent with our partyʼs commitment to equality for all
regardless of sexual orientation, Plaid Cymru strongly supports the aspirations of our
LGBT membership to achieve equal marriage.
Although LGBT members of Plaid Pride expressed a desire to retain civil
partnerships as an available alternative, Plaid Cymru anticipates that many same-sex
couples in Wales choosing to formalise their partnership together will opt for civil
marriage.

Question 4: If you represent a group of individuals who identify as being lesbian, gay,
bisexual or transsexual would those you represent wish to have a civil marriage
ceremony?
YES
Plaid Pride, Plaid Cymruʼs affiliate group for LGBT members and supporters, was
launched in 2010 to represent the interests of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
members and to promote LGBT policies both within the party and in the wider
community. In considering the proposals currently under consultation, Plaid Prideʼs
LGBT members and supporters have articulated their desire to have their
relationships recognised equally to those of opposite sex couples by means of a civil
marriage, and Plaid Cymru as a party supports our affiliate groupʼs position.
Plaid Cymruʼs wider membership has consistently supported legislative measures
and campaigns in the community that would extend equal rights to lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender people. We were one of the first political parties in the UK
to vote in favour of a motion supporting equal marriage at our party conference. We
also note the broad support from the electorate in Wales for such a move: in a 2009
Populus Opinion poll for The Times, 56% of respondents from Wales and South West

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

England agreed with the statement that “Gay couples should have an equal right to
get married, not just to have civil partnerships”2.
Plaid Cymru supported the governmentʼs ratification of section 202 of the Equality Act
2010, which authorised civil partnership registrations on religious premises on a nonmandatory basis.3 We are also aware that some LGBT couples may also aspire to
formalise their marriage in a religious setting. Plaid Cymru believes that the
governmentʼs logic for authorising voluntary registration of civil partnerships on
religious premises can and should be replicated for the equal marriage proposals
currently under consultation. Namely, while we firmly reject any mandate on faith
groups, Plaid Cymru supports a removal of the ban on religious organisations that
actively choose to conduct marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples (see question
5).
Plaid Cymru believes that equal marriage will further the development of a confident,
outward looking, free and prosperous Wales, help mitigate the continuing prejudice
and discrimination faced by LGBT people.

Question 5: The Government does not propose to open up religious marriage to
same-sex couples. Do you agree or disagree with this proposal?
DISAGREE – religious marriage should be opened up to same-sex couples
Plaid Cymru recognises the critical importance of religious liberty to a democratic and
free society. We fully respect the spiritual and doctrinal position of all religious
organisations that oppose same-sex marriage. We would therefore firmly reject any
mandate on faith organisations to conduct same-sex marriages.
However, Plaid Cymru notes that a number of faith communities have expressly
stated their desire to conduct same-sex marriages on religious premises, including
the Quakers in Britain4, Liberal Judaism5, the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches6, and the Movement for Reform Judaism7.
Paragraph 1.7 of Equal Civil Marriage: A Consultation observes that “We have
listened to those religious organisations that raised concerns about the redefinition of
religious marriage”8 while making no mention of those faith communities that recently
have made representations to the government urging a non-mandatory, opt-in
approach to religious same-sex marriage.9
Yet as recently as November 2011, the UK governmentʼs permissive approach to the
registration of civil partnerships on religious premises gave explicit recognition to the
position of those very same organisations, arguing that such an approach would
represent “a positive step forward for both LGB rights and religious freedom”10
(emphasis ours).

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

For example, paragraphs 1.8 and 1.9 of the November 2011 document Summary of
responses – Civil partnerships on religious premises: A consultation, note:
“1.8 […] Section 202 was designed to be a permissive piece of legislation
– its aim was to remove a legal barrier in order to support freedom of
religion for those organisations which wish to host civil partnership
registrations on their premises.
1.9 The voluntary nature of section 202 was at the heart of the proposals
outlined in the consultation document. The proposals were designed to
put in place a regime that enables faith groups to opt in, respects the
different decision-making structures of different faith groups, protects
faith groups and individual ministers from the risk of successful legal
challenge if they do not wish to host civil partnership registrations, and is
straightforward for local authorities to operate.”
Plaid Cymru endorses this logic since it is grounded not only in equal rights for LGBT
people, but in religious liberty for organisations that choose to opt in, and respect and
freedom from state sanction for those organisations that do not. We therefore fail to
see the case for a new division enacted into law that sanctions a permissive
approach for civil partnership declarations but retains an outright prohibition for those
religious groups that actively seek to solemnise same-sex marriages.
Here, Plaid Cymru notes the parallel consultation on civil partnerships and equal
marriage being carried out by the Scottish Government.11 We are disappointed that
the UK government did not replicate the far broader approach to consulting on this
issue that is being undertaken in Scotland. With respect to equal marriage on
religious premises (and the use of religious ritual to solemnise marriage), Paragraph
3.13 of the Scottish consultation document notes:
“The Government… considers that no religious body or individual
celebrant should be required to solemnise same sex marriage. The
Government recognises and understands that some religious bodies and
celebrants hold that marriage is a unique bond between a man and a
woman. The Government does not consider it would be appropriate to
require religious bodies and celebrants who hold this belief to solemnise
same sex marriage.”
The Scottish Government is therefore clear in its proposals that religious
organisations should not be obliged to solemnise same sex marriages. But
Paragraph 3.19 continues:
“The alternative view is that same sex couples of faith may wish to have
a religious ceremony and the state should not stop religious bodies and
religious celebrants who are content to solemnise same sex marriage
from doing so.“
!

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

Plaid Cymru supports the adoption of a similarly inclusive approach for Wales. Such
an approach would increase religious freedom for those faith organisations that
actively wish to conduct same-sex marriage, while giving full recognition and respect
to the deeply-held views of religious organisations who are opposed to same-sex
marriage. A permissive law would need to ensure full respect to the internal
decision-making processes of religious organisations in relation to same-sex
marriage. But a policy that respects religious freedom of conscience would be a
fairer and more robust system than a continuing outright ban imposed by the UK
government.

Question 6: Do you agree or disagree with keeping the option of civil partnerships
once civil marriage is available to same-sex couples?
AGREE
Plaid Cymru believes that civil partnerships offer a strong and well-supported legal
framework for recognition of a loving partnership between two individuals. Although
we support a non-mandatory extension of religious marriage to same-sex couples
(see question 5), under the governmentʼs current proposals, civil partnerships would
be the only commitment ceremony available for couples choosing to formalise their
relationship on religious premises.
Notwithstanding the question of religious marriage, Plaid Cymru anticipates that
some LGBT couples will continue to choose civil partnership rather than a civil
marriage. We therefore agree that the option of civil partnerships should be retained
after the introduction of equal civil marriage.

Question 7: If you identify as being lesbian, gay, bisexual and were considering
making a legal commitment to your partner would you prefer to have a civil
partnership or a civil marriage?
LGBT members of Plaid Cymruʼs LGBT affiliate group, Plaid Pride, look forward to
civil marriage as a public celebration and solemnisation of their commitment to their
partners. We also anticipate that other LGBT couples will likely continue to choose a
civil partnership as the best expression of their love and relationship to one another.
LGBT members of Plaid Pride believe that a decision on marriage or civil partnership
is a choice that is best left to the individual, and that couples of all sexual orientations
should be given the freedom to choose whichever option best reflects their personal
aspirations for recognition of their partnership.

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

Question 8: The Government is not considering opening up civil partnerships to
opposite-sex couples. Do you agree or disagree with this proposal?
DISAGREE – civil partnerships should be opened up to opposite-sex couples
Reflecting our partyʼs support expressed in this consultation response for an inclusive
framework for the legal recognition of partnerships, Plaid Cymru advocates the
extension of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples.
Retaining civil partnerships for same-sex couples only will continue an inappropriate
and unfair legal delineation for recognising relationships that is grounded solely on
the basis of sexual orientation.
Further, if civil partnerships are available for same-sex couples only, LGBT
individuals will in effect have to declare their sexuality on any official forms that solicit
such information, despite any inclination they may have to the contrary.
Ultimately, the choice for legally recognising a coupleʼs love and commitment should
be made by the couple themselves, not the government. Plaid Cymru notes the
successful introduction of civil or domestic partnerships for opposite-sex couples in
jurisdictions as diverse as France, New Zealand and the US states of Illinois and
Hawaii. We also note that opposite-sex civil or domestic partnerships co-exist with
same-sex marriage in the Netherlands, South Africa and in the Canadian provinces
of Quebec and Nova Scotia.

Question 9: If you are in a civil partnership would you wish to take advantage of this
policy and convert your civil partnership into a marriage?
Having consulted with the LGBT members of Plaid Pride, Plaid Cymru supports the
option of conversion of civil partnerships into marriage, but argues that such a
process should be made at minimal cost and effort to the couple concerned. Other
couples may wish to conduct a more formal celebration of their conversion from civil
partnership to marriage, and an option that reflects this aspiration should be made
available (see question 11).
Plaid Cymru would not support an automatic conversion process from civil
partnership to marriage, since we anticipate that some civil partners may choose to
retain their current status.

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

Question 10: Do you agree or disagree that there should be a time limit on the ability
to convert a civil partnership into a marriage?
AGREE – there shouldnʼt be a time limit
Plaid Cymru does not see the case for an arbitrary time limit on conversion, for three
primary reasons.
First, and subsequent to the introduction of equal civil marriage, some same-sex
couples may choose to first enter into a civil partnership before later converting their
relationship to a marriage. An arbitrary time limit on conversion would foreclose this
possibility.
Second, and depending on the cost of a conversion certificate, a time limit may
disproportionately affect those on very low incomes who may have to save to afford a
conversion to marriage. A short window may therefore cause undue distress for civil
partners who need extra time to convert their relationship after the introduction of
equal civil marriage.
Third, because the governmentʼs proposals currently intend to retain the ban on
same-sex marriages on religious premises, some civil partners who celebrated their
partnership ceremony on religious premises may choose to wait for conversion to
marriage, in the hope that this ban is removed on a non-mandatory, permissive basis
at some point in the future. Here again, an arbitrary time period for conversion would
force religious same-sex couples to opt for marriage more quickly than they might
otherwise choose, and/or may require such couples to undergo yet another
conversion of their relationship status if religious marriage is subsequently permitted
in the future.

Question 11: Do you agree or disagree that there should be the choice to have a civil
ceremony on conversion of a civil partnership into a marriage?
YES, there should be an option
While some couples would choose a simple and low cost conversion from civil
partnership to marriage, other civil partners may wish to have a more public
declaration and celebration of their new marriage. Plaid Cymru supports both
conversion options being made available to couples currently in a civil partnership at
a reasonable cost that does not exceed that of civil marriage for opposite-sex
couples.

Question 12: If you are a married transsexual person would you want to take
advantage of this policy and remain in your marriage while obtaining a full Gender
Recognition Certificate?
In consulting with the LGBT members of Plaid Pride, Plaid Cymru enthusiastically
welcomes the proposals outlined in paragraph 2.29 that would end the distressing
and intrusive present requirement that transgender individuals must end their existing
marriage or civil partnership before legally changing their gender by means of a full
Gender Recognition Certificate.
We would note, however, that absent civil partnerships being accessible for oppositesex couples, occasional circumstances may arise in which such discrimination
continues to be faced by transgender people. Namely, this approach may require
dissolution of a civil partnership prior to obtaining a full Gender Recognition
Certificate if the couple does not wish to convert their relationship to marriage.
A further consideration relates to those transgender individuals who are in transition.
Since obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate can take many years, certain
individuals who have transitioned but do not yet have a Gender Recognition
Certificate may be required to wait several years to legally enter into a marriage, and
may have to register a civil partnership first.
A truly equal legal partnership system – one that opens civil partnerships to oppositesex couples and a non-mandatory system for religious marriage for same-sex
couples – would assist in removing such inequalities.
With respect to paragraph 2.30, given the relatively small number of transgender
individuals who may have been required to end their marriage and enter into a civil
partnership since 2005, we would strongly urge the government to reconsider
whether retrospective reinstatement of benefit contributions or entitlements from the
coupleʼs original marriage can be undertaken at minimal cost.

Question 13: If you are the spouse of a transsexual person, would you want to take
advantage of this policy and remain in your marriage whilst your spouse obtained a
full Gender Recognition Certificate?
Please see our response to Question 12.

Question 14: Do you have any comments on the assumptions or issues outlined in
this chapter on consequential impacts? Please respond within 1,225 characters
(approx 200 words).
International Recognition: Plaid Cymru urges the UK Government to continue all
efforts to advocate greater overseas recognition of same-sex civil partnerships and
marriages performed in the UK. We recommend that the Government recognises
overseas same-sex marriages as marriages in the UK, and overseas civil unions and
civil partnerships as civil partnerships in the UK.
Devolution: Even prior to the national referendum in March 2011 that endorsed a
direct, primary law-making Senedd, Welsh and English family law and administrative
law were already becoming increasingly distinct. Plaid Cymru supports the
devolution of responsibility and funding for criminal justice and family law to the
National Assembly for Wales, which would include responsibility for marriage law as
in Scotland and Northern Ireland. By way of a devolved justice system and a
separate legal jurisdiction, Plaid Cymru believes that the National Assembly and
people of Wales are better placed to tailor a justice system to the distinctive social
and economic needs of Wales.

Question 15: Are you aware of any costs or benefits that exist to either the public or
private sector, or individuals that we have not accounted for? Please respond within
1,225 characters (approx 200 words).
Plaid Cymru is not aware of any additional costs to individuals or to the public and
private sectors other than those outlined in the Impact Assessment accompanying
Equal civil marriage: A consultation. In line with the introduction of civil partnerships
in 2005, we anticipate that there will be a sharp increase in demand for civil marriage
in the first 18 months of implementation,12 both from couples converting from civil
partnership status and from couples that are new to the legal partnership system.
As noted in the Impact Assessment, the hosting of civil marriage ceremonies will
result in financial benefits to private businesses in the hospitality and leisure sector,
public bodies such as local authorities and Cadw whose venues are licensed to
perform civil marriage ceremonies, and to HM Treasury through increased VAT
receipts “that would almost certainly exceed fiscal costs”.13

Question 16: Do you have any other comments on the proposals within this
consultation? Please respond within 1,225 characters (approx 200 words)
In common with the politics of modern Wales, the policies of Plaid Cymru are
grounded on the values of fairness and social justice for all. We believe that civil
marriage for all couples, regardless of gender, will further the development of a
confident and prosperous Wales. In removing the barrier to civil marriage, these
!

EQUAL CIVIL MARRIAGE: A CONSULTATION RESPONSE

proposals will help combat lingering perceptions that same-sex relationships are in
some way less valued than opposite-sex relationships in modern society.
We have encouraged a more progressive approach to these proposals, particularly
with respect to the continuing ban on those faith organisations that wish to solemnise
same-sex marriages on religious premises, and the continued exclusion of oppositesex couples from the civil partnership system. We have also noted our conviction
that the National Assembly for Wales should be conferred with primary legislative
responsibility for marriage law, as is the case in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Nevertheless, Plaid Cymru believes that equal civil marriage represents a significant
advancement in the equality and equal rights of LGBT people, and will yield
economic benefits for the hospitality sector, public bodies and the Treasury. We
therefore proudly look forward to celebrating the first marriages between LGBT
couples in Wales.
