But Labour ultimately wants to move towards a Graduate Tax instead of fees. The Guardian quotes Liam Byrne, Shadow Higher Education Secretary as saying: 'The policy we've set out is what we would do if we were in government today. Ed Miliband also said in his leadership campaign our long-term goal must be to move towards a graduate tax. (...) What we'll have to do in our manifesto is take our starting point of £6k fees, explain how we see the situation for 2015 to 2020, and how we'll see a long-term shift to a graduate tax.' So, long-term, Labour wants to abolish fees (AND REPLACE WITH GRADUATE TAX), but will certainly not do so immediately if elected. 	http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/30/labour-cut-student-tuition-fees-6000-a-year

It sides with the Conservatives in regarding the mansion tax as a tax on 'aspiration'.  UKIP's Deputy Chair was recently highly critical of the idea of a mansion tax:   'Evans advocates reducing the top rate of income tax to 40 per cent and criticises the mansion tax as a policy of 'Äúvengeance'Äù against the wealthy, saying it could be 'Äúequally unconscionable'Äù to the bedroom tax. Residents in her old ward with houses worth over £2m 'Äúwere very often widows on a very low income 'Äì they can't afford to pay mansion tax. In a sense they would have been in exactly the same position as people on the bedroom tax being forced out.'Äù Labour's proposal for a mansion tax would only affect those who earn at least £42,000 a year, but Evans asks: 'ÄúDo you honestly think they're going to stop at that?'Äù'	http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/ukip-deputy-chair-suzanne-evans-mansion-tax-equally-unconscionable-bedroom-tax

It sides with the Conservatives in regarding the mansion tax as a tax on 'aspiration'.  UKIP's Deputy Chair was recently highly critical of the idea of a mansion tax:   'Evans advocates reducing the top rate of income tax to 40 per cent and criticises the mansion tax as a policy of 'Äúvengeance'Äù against the wealthy, saying it could be 'Äúequally unconscionable'Äù to the bedroom tax. Residents in her old ward with houses worth over £2m 'Äúwere very often widows on a very low income 'Äì they can't afford to pay mansion tax.
