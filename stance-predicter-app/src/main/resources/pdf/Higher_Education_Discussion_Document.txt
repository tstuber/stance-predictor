Higher Education / Tuition Fees ___________________________________ Plaid Cymru – the Party of Wales Discussion Paper

Higher Education / Tuition Fees Paper UK Background Between 1962 and 1990 UK-based students studying first degrees on a full-time basis paid no tuition fees and received 100% grants for maintenance, means tested according to parental income. Student loans were introduced in the academic year 1990/91 and progressively replaced grants for living costs. A means tested tuition fee of £1,000, representing about a quarter of the total cost of tuition, was introduced in the UK in September 1998. The student grant was abolished and replaced by incomecontingent student loans on the grounds that student living costs should be met out of future graduate earnings and in part by their parents where they could afford to do so.1 Following devolution, many changes were made throughout the UK.
In England, variable tuition fees were introduced in academic year 2006/07. The Higher Education Act 2004 made it possible for English HEIs to charge variable deferred fees, providing they had an access plan agreed by the Office for Fair Access
(OFFA). The fee is met through a government loan which is paid back by the student once a certain level of income is attained. As a consequence, the requirement to pay an upfront fee was effectively abolished. The maximum annual tuition fee for students studying at English universities in academic year 2011/12 is £3,375. 2 Current situation in Wales Income and expenditure of Welsh HEIs, by income and expenditure type and year

The above table shows that in 2010/11, 33.5% of HEI’s total income came from funding council grants, 33% from tuition fees, 13.2% from research grants, 19.2%
from other income and 0.7% from endowment and investment income.
In academic year 2007/08, Welsh HEIs were able to charge variable tuition fees of up to £3,070. However, Welsh and EU domiciled students studying in Wales were eligible to receive the non means-tested Tuition Fee Grant of up to £1,845 towards their tuition fee. This effectively limited the fee charged to this group of students to a maximum of £1,225 with the grant meeting 60% of the tuition fee. Tuition fee loans were available to meet the difference. The rules changed in academic year 2010/11 when the tuition fee grant was abolished and replaced by an increased tuition fee loan. There is, however, a tuition fee grant of £2,020 for academic year 2011/12 available to continuing students who started their course on or after 1 September 2006, but before 1 September 2010. The maximum annual tuition fee for students studying in Welsh universities for academic year 2011/12 is £3,375.3 Plaid Cymru Policy Plaid Cymru’s policy on tuition fees was updated at the 2010 conference with the passing of the following motion.
Higher Education Tuition Fees Conference believes:
1. That the party's current policy is for free education within higher education.
2. The last time top up fees were introduced in England, top up fees were introduced in Wales for non-Welsh-domiciled students studying in Wales some years later.
3. That the Welsh Government recently scrapped the tuition fee grant in favour of a national bursary scheme.
4. That one of the main Liberal Democrats' pledges during the 2010 General Election was to phase out and end tuition fees in higher education.
5. That the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government agreement notes that Liberal Democrat MPs will abstain on any vote on the funding of higher education that they disagree with.
6. That the average student debt in England, according to Push, currently stands at over £20,000.
7. The current funding gap between Welsh and English higher education institutions currently stands at around £60 million.

Conference further believes:
1. That if fees rise in England, the funding gap between Welsh and English universities will only get bigger.
2. That if fees go up in England, Wales will be forced to source extra funding to ensure our universities remain competitive.
3. That it's unacceptable to expect students to pay more for their education when the quality of education hasn’t improved since top up fees were last introduced.
Conference resolves:
1. To oppose any further increase in tuition fees in England, and to vote against an increase in fees when the question should arise in the Westminster Parliament.
2. To oppose any increase in fees in Wales should the matter arise in the Welsh Government.
3. To support the abolition of tuition fees.
Conference calls on the Welsh Government to promote the national bursary scheme extensively across the nation.
The Browne Review The Browne Review was commissioned by the UK Government in 2009, following calls for more funding to be made available for universities. The Review looks at the future of higher education funding.
The review was published on 12 October 2010 and contained proposals to remove the cap on tuition fees. The UK Government accepted most of the recommendations and on 3 November 2010, announced plans to reform higher education and student finance from 2012/13.
The main changes are:




4

From 2012/13 HEI will be able to charge up to £6,000 a year for their courses.
Some will be able to charge up to £9,000 a year if they meet strict criteria to make sure that all eligible students, regardless of background, can access those courses. Access arrangements need to be approved by the Office for fair Access.
Government loans will be available to pay tuition fees so students do not have to pay fees upfront. Loans will need to be paid back when the student starts earning over £21,000 a year (previously the repayment threshold was
£15,000). Each month graduates will pay back 9% of their income above that threshold. For example, someone with a salary of £25,000 a year would pay back 9% of £4,000. Fee loans will also be available to part-time students.






The interest rate will be raised. For graduates earning between £21,000 and
£41,000 interest will be applied between RPI and RPI plus 3% on a gradual scale depending on income.
All outstanding debt will be written off after 30 years (from the current 25 years).
Loans for living costs will be available and non-repayable grants, depending on household income, will also be available.

Implications of the Browne Review The implementation of Browne review recommendations in England affects the other UK nations for the following reasons:




If other UK nations do not raise tuition fees, their universities will be considered cheaper options with students, treated as customers, considering cheaper options to be less valuable options.
A ‘funding gap’ between England and other UK nationscould arise with higher fees in England going towards teaching in universities while other nations would face cuts in teaching funding which could result in students and lecturers choosing English rather than Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish universities due to them being better funded.

In Scotland, a joint Scottish Government and Universities Scotland technical working group report came out in 2011 and estimated that the annual funding gap in Scotland could be between £97m and £263m by 2014-15. Following the report, the Scottish Government estimated that the net funding gap that would have to be filled would be around £93m, after the potential income from higher fees to students from other UK nations was taken into account.
However, as noted in the Scottish Parliament briefing paper, Higher Education:
Tuition fees and the ‘funding gap’:
“Identifying an exact figure for the funding gap is difficult as it will depend on how many students actually take up courses from AY 2012-13, what courses they take up…and the potential for changes to fee levels by English HEIs in the future.”4 England from 2012/13 The average fee for HEIs is £8,470 or £8,176 after fee waivers are taken into account.
This means that for an average 3 year degree the fee would be £25,410 or £24, 582 after fee waivers are taken into account.
Scotland from 2012/13 4

Following Browne, the Scottish Government confirmed its opposition to making Scotland-domiciled students pay for tuition fees at Scottish HEIs. Instead, it has allowed Scottish HEIs to charge students from other UK nations an increased tuition fee from 2012/13. In addition, it has increased public funding of HEI by £135.5m. It is also investigating the possibility of charging EU students.
The Student Fees Order 2006 was made under the Further and Higher Education Act 2005. The Order sets out the tuition fee level and allows Ministers to increase fees specified in the Order without the need for further legislation, as long as fee level rises are not greater than inflation. The Scottish Government has introduced secondary legislation which allows Scottish HEIs to set their own fees to students from other UK nations from 2012/13, with a voluntary arrangement in place to cap maximum variable fees for students from other UK nations at £9,000 per annum.
The Government intends to introduce primary legislation to restrict the fees that HEIs can charge for students from other UK nations to this cap from 2013-14 onwards.
The Student Fees Order 2011 sets out tuition fees for higher level courses of education for full-time students and the regulations have the effect of limiting the fees set by the 2011 Order to students who can demonstrate a ‘relevant connection’
with Scotland or who are excepted students within the meaning of Schedule 1 of the Education (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations.
The Scottish Government’s rationale is that under EU law all students have the same rights and obligations as local students. However, these EU rules do not apply between ‘regions’ of a Member State so different arrangements can be made for students across the UK5 Problems with the Scottish Government’s policy include the following:



The possibility that Scottish higher education will become too expensive for students from other UK nations and that demand will therefore, reduce.
There is no requirement on Scottish HEIs to offer bursaries to support students from deprived backgrounds to study and Scottish universities have recently been subject to criticism for having low participation rates for students from less affluent areas.

The Welsh Government’s policy from 2012/13 Like the other UK Governments, the Welsh Government had to respond to changes to tuition fees policy in England as it affects Welsh universities. The following sets out how the Welsh Government has developed its tuition fees policy since the Browne review.

Education Minister Leighton Andrews made an oral statement on ‘Higher Education Strategy’on 30 November 2010 outlining the Welsh Government’s proposals.
“The state cannot shirk its responsibility to intervene to secure inclusion and to build community cohesion. However, as I have explained previously, approximately 16,000 Welsh undergraduates study in England so, charging, say, a £7,000 fee on average to Welsh students going to English universities could result in a cost to the Welsh Assembly Government of an additional £70 million by 2015-16.
Of this, £55 million would effectively flow from the Welsh block into English universities. If we are to create an affordable and sustainable solution for Welsh-domiciled students and HE provision in Wales, then we will need to respond creatively to this challenge.
“Therefore, I am announcing today that we propose the following: basic tuition fees in Wales will increase to £6,000 per annum from the academic year 2012-13 and higher education institutions will be able to charge tuition fees up to £9,000 per annum, provided that they can demonstrate a commitment to widening access and other strategic objectives through fee plans approved by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales in line with its corporate strategy announced in June this year; the income repayment threshold for student loans will increase from £15,000 to £21,000, and variable progressive rates of interest charged depending on income; part-time students will be able to access a tuition fee loan depending on the level of intensity of their course; and to help control the total cost of higher education to the Assembly Government’s budget there will continue to be a cap on the number of publicly-funded student places in Wales. The intention is that the changes proposed would be introduced with effect from 2012-13 for new students only.
“However, I am pleased to say that Welsh-domiciled students will pay no more in 2012-13 than they would have done if fees were not being increased to those levels. From 2012-13, Welsh-domiciled students will continue to be eligible for subsidised loans to meet the cost of fees up to the current level. However, the Welsh Assembly Government will also provide a non-means-tested tuition fee waiver or grant for the balance over and above current fee levels. This grant will be payable through HEFCW on behalf of Welsh-domiciled students wherever they study. In other words, the increase in fees for Welsh-domiciled students, whether they study in England or Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland, will be paid by the Welsh Assembly Government. Welshdomiciled students will not have to find either £6,000 or £9,000 to study. The public purse will continue to subsidise higher education for Welsh-domiciled students. Welsh students who go to university in 2012-13 will be paying the same in real terms as students going to university in this academic year.

“We will pay for this by top-slicing the HEFCW teaching grant.
However, Welsh higher education institutions will still enjoy a higher level of teaching grant support than institutions in England. The Browne report proposed an 80 per cent cut in the university teaching grant in England, which appeared to be confirmed in the CSR. In Wales, the teaching grant will be reduced by only 35 per cent. The income of Welsh higher education institutions will be at least the same in real terms in 2016-17 as it will be in 2012-13.” (Leighton Andrews)
A written statement,‘Forecast for Income to the Higher Education Sector in Wales 2011-12 to 2016-17’ issued on 15 December 2010, further analyses funding for HEI and states that the policy is affordable:
Additional income resulting from increased full-time fees is estimated by projecting forward student numbers and assuming an average fee level of £7,000 for 2012 entrants, followed by inflationary increases.
Other than the funding body grant and fees for full-time students, other strands of income such as research income are assumed to be constant over time, in real terms.” (Leighton Andrews)
A written statement on ‘Draft Regulations on Tuition Fees’ was issued on 15 February 2011 in which the Minister announced that, following a consultation exercise, the basic fee amount was to be lowered from £6,000 to £4,000.
In a written statement on ‘Draft Regulations on Tuition Fees’issued on March 10 2011 the Minister announced that to honour the commitment made in the One Wales programme for government to widen participation in further and higher education, HEI wishing to charge fees of up to £9,000 can do so “provided that they could demonstrate a commitment to widening access and other strategic objectives. They must do this through fee plans approved by HEFCW.”
In a written statement on ‘HEFCW Regulations’ issued on25 May 2011, the Minister announced
“Those institutions which wish to charge tuition fees above the basic amount of £4,000 for full-time undergraduate courses must submit their fee plans to HEFCW for approval. I expect HEFCW to operate a robust assessment of the content and quality of institutional fee plans.”(Leighton Andrews)
The Minister issued a written statement on 11 June 2011 following HEFCW’s disapproval of the fee plans it had received:
“In June HEFCW notified all institutions that none of their fee plans met the necessary requirements, and institutions were asked to carry out further work to ensure that the requirements were met.
“Today HEFCW has notified institutions of the outcome of the Council’s consideration of their re-submitted fee plans. The majority of institutions will have approved plans in place for the 2012/13 academic 8

year. Institutions’ plans specify the additional investment they will make to promote equality of opportunity, including the arrangements for supporting students from disadvantaged backgrounds.” (Leighton Andrews)
On 4 November 2011, the Minister issued a written statement stating that changes to part time student support have been delayed until 2013-14:
“Having considered the consultation responses, I have decided to postpone implementation of a revised system for part-time higher education tuition fees and student support until academic year 2013/14. I am keen to use this period to reflect on the changes that we have introduced in Wales during the past twelve months and to analyse more closely the impact that future changes will have on part-time study in Wales.” (Leighton Andrews)
On 21 May 2012, the Minister issued a written statement on ‘amendments to the student loan repayment regulations.’ He stated that this is ‘the final major piece of legislation that implements the reforms to the higher education and student finance system that I announced in November 2010.’The changes only apply to students commencing their courses in September 2012 or later. However, “Certain students transferring courses or taking higher level courses starting after September 2012, but immediately after completing a previous Higher Education qualification, will remain under the existing arrangements.”
The main changes will be:








New students starting a higher education course from September 2012 onwards will be charged interest at RPI (Retail Price Index) + 3% whilst studying. In most cases, this rate will apply until the borrower either leaves or completes his or her course. At that point, the rate of interest charged will depend upon the borrower’s income. Borrowers earning £21,000 or less will be charged a rate equivalent to Retail Price Index (RPI). Interest will then be charged on a sliding scale up to £41,000 where the interest rate will be RPI +
3%.
The repayment threshold will be £21,000 “Borrowers will not be required to make any repayments before 6 April 2016 (although borrowers may choose to do so). After 6 April 2016, those earning above the income threshold and who are due to repay will repay 9% of their income above £21,000. Full-time students will be due to repay from the 6th April after they complete or leave their course.”
The debt will be written off after 30 years. The loan will also be cancelled if the borrower dies or the borrower receives a disability related benefit and, because of the disability, is permanently unfit for work.
Credit balance - Interest Rate. The regulations implement new interest rate provisions for both new and existing borrowers who have a student loan

balance in credit due to over-repayment. This change will apply from 6 April 2016, and will mean that the Student Loans Company will not, after a period of 60 days notice to the borrower, apply interest to credit balances.
The Welsh Government issued a white paper on Further and Higher Education on 2 July 2012. The key proposals relevant to tuition fees are:



Reform of the functions of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales including quality assurance and enhancement of higher education provision.
Welsh Minister’s powers of direct funding of higher education provision to support partnership and collaborative activity.

There were 20,876 applicants from Wales to all UK universities.
There were 3,086 applicants from non-UK EU countries to Welsh universities.
There were 36,195 applicants from England to Welsh universities.
There were 935 applicants from Northern Ireland to Welsh universities.
There were 190 applicants from Scotland to Welsh universities.

However, many universities will not be charging the full fee of £9,000 and the basic fee rate is £4,000.
HEFCW issued a press release in July 2011 stating that the average fee level in Wales in 2012/13 will be £8,800.
The table below shows the total income coming into Welsh HEIs from students from other UK nations, using UCAS’s applicant numbers for 2012-13 and HEFCWs average fee level.

The Welsh Government has allocated £380,424,000 for Higher Education in its 2012-13 budget.
Coupled with the income gained from students from other UK students studying in Wales, this gives HEIs an income of £708,840,000.
Higher Education priorities The Welsh Government’s HE strategy For our Future6 sets out the following two fundamental priorities for Higher Education:



To deliver social justice.
To support a buoyant economy.

The following actions are set out to target social justice and economic success:







Develop a regional dimension to planning and delivery of higher education Develop greater diversity and flexibility in programme design, duration and delivery to match need and demand.
Increase the impact of university research, through targeting support on areas of strength and national priority, and promoting collaboration.
Enable study through the medium of Welsh to take place in a wider range of programmes and locations in Wales Increase collaboration among higher education providers and between higher education and other providers Promote the role of higher education providers as corporate citizens

The following actions are set out to target social justice:





Target financial support to promote and sustain access to higher education Ensure that the student voice strengthens higher education

The following actions are set out to target economic performance:



Strengthen the contribution of higher education to workforce development Strengthen the exploitation of knowledge

Access to Higher Education The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) target from its Child poverty Strategy 2013-15 is:
“A 10% rise in the proportion of all Welsh domiciled students studying higher education courses at higher education institutions and further education institutions in Wales who are domiciled in the Welsh Communities First areas from 15.6% in 2008/09 to 17.2% in 2012/13.”7 Student Support Students who normally live in Wales are eligible for financial support from Student Finance Wales regardless of where in the UK they are studying. Non-UK EUdomiciled students are also eligible for financial support. This follows European law which states that:
“As an EU citizen, you are entitled to study at university in any EU country under the same conditions as national; you cannot be required to pay higher course fees and you are entitled to the same grants to cover course fees as nationals of the country.”8 However, the rules on tuition fee loans /grants are different from those on maintenance grans/loans. Member States are not obliged to extend maintenance grants/loans to other EU nationals.9 A tuition fee loan is available to students to cover all of the first part of tuition fees charged by the university, up to a maximum of £3465. If the fee charged by the university is more than £3465, the student is also eligible for a tuition fee grant to cover the difference between the maximum loan and actual fee. Students do not start to pay back the loan until they earn £21000 or more per year. The rate is 9% of anything they earn over £21,000 per year.Students can make voluntary repayments at any time.

Students are also eligible for maintenance loans of a maximum of £3,673 if living with parents, £6,648 if living in their own home and studying in London, £4,745 if living in their own home and studying outside London, and £5,658 if studying overseas.
For courses longer than 30 term time weeks, students are eligible for an extra amount of maintenance loan of: £55 if living with parents, £106 if living in their own home and studying in London, £83 if living in their own home and studying outside London and £115 if studying overseas.
Students who take a maintenance loan in 2012/13 can have up to £1,500 cancelled from their student loan balance by the Welsh Government.
The student’s local authority student finance office assesses their eligibility for support and the Student Loans Company handles the payments.Local authorities can use household income to decide the level of finance offered to the student.
Household income is the combined income of the student and the parent(s) or partner they live with.
Certain students are eligible for a special support grant, this applies to: students with caring responsibilities; students with a disability and students aged 60 or older.
Eligible students with household incomes of £18,370 or less a year can receive
£5,000 a year; students with a household income of £18,370 to £50,020 a year are entitled to between £50 and £5,000 a year.
HEFCW HEFCW is the body responsible for allocating funding to universities in Wales. It also has responsibility for ensuring that the Welsh Government’s priorities relating to HEas set out in For our Future: the economy and access to HE are met. Its role is changing due to changes in the way in which HE is funded; the emphasis is moving away from funding from the teaching grant allocated by HEFCW to funding through tuition fee loans and grants administered by the Welsh Government to Welsh and EU-domiciled students and tuition fees paid by students from the other UK nations.
As set out in the Welsh Government’s White Paper on Further and Higher Education;
“Under the new funding arrangements introduced from academic year 2012/13, the majority of HE teaching funding will shift from teaching grant, which is currently allocated to institutions by HEFCW under section 65 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, to student fee grants and fee loans.
By the 2014/15 academic year it is possible that some institutions will no longer be in receipt of teaching grant from HEFCW. This shift in funding arrangements will have implications for the continued discharge of HEFCW’s

14

statutory functions: specifically, its ability to exercise fee planning, the control of student numbers and quality assessment.”10 On April 5 2012 HEFCW issued a press release outlining its plans to reallocate student numbers in 2013/14 in order to “address unintended consequences of the new fees regime in Wales which, if left uncorrected, would see a disproportionate amount of funding supporting less expensive and non-priority subjects to the detriment of other priorities.”
The exercise is also intended to “reduce the cost of fee grants for students from Wales and the EU, thereby ensuring that more funding remains available for Welsh Government priorities for higher education.”
Under the new system:



All full time undergraduate and PGCE new entrant student numbers for priority and expensive subjects will be retained by universities.
All remaining full time undergraduate and PGCE new entrant student numbers will be redistributed to universities based on two factors:
o How well the university is performing under For our Future aims, particularly those not addressed by fee plans, e.g. targets for research income.
o Whether institutions reduce their average fee to £7,500 or less.

Fee Plans From 1 September 2012, the basic amount of tuition fees will be set at £4,000,the highest amount will be £9,000. For some courses (where periods of full time study are less such as teacher training courses or sandwich courses) the basic amount is prescribed at £2,000 and the higher amount is prescribed as £4,500.
From 2012/13 onwards, any institution in Wales which intends to charge students more than the basic amount for any of its courses must have a fee plan approved by HEFCW.HEFCW will also be responsible for monitoring their compliance with their fee plans.
The fee plan will state the amount, up to £9,000 the institution intends to charge for a course. The fee plans of institutions which intend to charge above the basic amount must contain provisions relating to promoting equality of opportunity and promoting HE.
Fee plans should describe the proportions of an institution’s income from tuition fees charged above the basic amount which are earmarked for measures which promote equality of opportunity and promote HE. The maximum duration of fee plans is two years. The fee plan will set out how the institution expects its fee policies to evolve over the duration of the plan.

Fee plans and HEFCW’s wider role concernsimproving the ‘student experience’, as well as widening access. Students are increasingly treated as consumers and therefore need as much information as possible to make their decisions on where they want to study. HEFCW’s role in this is to issue guidance to HE institutions on the information they should provide to prospective students, including up-to-date information on graduate earnings based on HEFCW’s proposed consultation on public information.
To advance equality of opportunity amongst under-represented groups, it is essential that those groups know about the financial support that they might receive in HE, both from the Welsh Government and individual institutions.Institutions must ensure that the fees they charge are clearly set out and publicly available, and that students are told what the fees will be for the duration of their course before they enrol for the first year.
Problems with the Welsh Government’s approach The Welsh Government’s approach is dependent on sufficient numbers of students from other UK countries studying at Welsh universities in order to fund them.
Due to the Welsh Government paying for Welsh-domiciled students to study at any UK university, if Welsh universities charge lower tuition fees than English, Scottish or Northern Irish universities, the Welsh Government is, essentially, subsidising those universities whilst allowing Welsh universities to be under-funded.
As a result, a ‘brain-drain’ could ensue, with Welsh students choosing to study at English, Scottish or Northern Irish universities, rather than under-funded Welsh universities. Many students who choose to study in England do not return to Wales and do not, therefore, contribute to the Welsh economy. As one of the two priorities for Higher Education is to boost the Welsh economy, this goes against the Welsh Government’s policy.
Another problem with this policy is that students from other UK nations may decide not to study at under-funded Welsh universities and as the policy is dependent on them doing so, this would lead to a spiral of decline with Welsh universities missing out on more and more funding as less students from other UK nations choose to study in Wales.
The Welsh Government is also currently pursuing the agenda of merging universities in Wales, this follows recommendations made by HEFCW in its corporate strategy for 2010/11 to 2012/13 that by 2013, 75% of HE institutions in Wales will have an annual income above the UK median, and none will be in the lower quartile. To achieve this, a smaller number of stronger universities would be needed. The Minister for Education and Skills has stated, in an oral statement onHigher Education Reconfiguration in South East Wales on July 17 2012 that he will not rule out using statutory powers to dissolve universities.

16

This ties in with the affordability of the Government’s approach to funding universities as it would make the Government’s tuition fees policy more affordable if there were less universities to be funded.
The White Paper on Further and Higher Education makes the proposal that the Welsh Ministers be given powers to “direct funding of higher education provision to support partnership and collaborative activity.”11 This suggests that the Welsh Government will use this power to ensure it is not financially viable for all universities who want to remain independent to do so.
The White Paper also set out that to control the total cost of HE to the Government’s budget, there will be “arrangements to cap the number of publicly funded places in Wales.”12 Other EU countries Many EU countries do not charge tuition fees. The following looks at the tuition fees and higher education funding policies of a few EU countries.

There are no higher education fees for EU students at Austrian Universities.
In 2001/02, obligatory tuition fees were introduced at universities and a study allowance was introduced to help students cover the cost of fees. However, in 2009 tuition fees were abolished for the majority of students and as a result, the use of study allowances has decreased.
18% of students receive a needs-based grant.
Direct and indirect aid is granted from the Government. Indirect grants are granted irrespective of social need and account for the largest share. Indirect aids include family allowance, insurance cover under parents’ health insurance or self-insurance and tax breaks to parents whose children study in the tertiary sector.
Direct aids are means-tested and linked to academic performance. Social need is defined on the basis of student earnings and/or the earnings of those liable for their support. There are also special support measures such as a study subsidy to pay for tuition fees, travel allowance, assistance for study abroad.
Students who are eligible include Austrian, EU and EEA, nationals; 3rd country nationals granted a long-term residence permit; stateless persons who together with parent were liable to pay income tax and mainly lived in Austria

Estonia has a population of 1.3 million and 68,000 students.
The percentage of GDP spent on public HE is 1.1.
Students with state-funded places do not pay fees but only half of all students have state-funded places and these are awarded on the basis of academic performance.
New reforms set out by the Estonian Government will create another 3,500 state funded places and introduce some needs based maintenance grants. This will mean 60% of Estonian students receive free higher education while 40%
will pay.
The number of student places is commissioned by the state based on the need for student places resulting from the level of unemployment and the opportunity to contribute public resources to further training.
Graduate schools were introduced in 2006 with funding from the European Social Fund. State-commissioned doctoral study places gradually increased with a goal of at least 300 doctoral theses a year to be defended in Estonia.

Financial aid is granted for study abroad if equivalent to studies entitled to aid in Finland.
Student financial aid comprises: study grant, housing supplement and state guarantee for student loan.
Financial aid is available for all university studies for up to seventy months.
Means testing usually involves the student’s own income and determines how many months of financial aid a student is entitled to.
Study grants paid by the state do not have to be repaid. University students receive a study grant amounting to 298 euros a month and eligibility is dependent on progress in studies.
A housing supplement is provided by the state and is a taxable income. The amount is equal to 80% of monthly rent but is not granted for any part of a rent that exceeds 252 euros a month.
Students who are eligible for study grants are also eligible for student loans.
Students apply for bank loan which is repayable but guaranteed by government.

Possible Approaches for Wales The approach taken to reforming tuition fees and HE funding in Wales depends on what we consider to be priorities. The Welsh Government’s priorities are the economy and widening access. The approach also needs to be sustainable and affordable.
Maintain current system As stated above, there are serious questions regarding the affordability of the current system due to its dependence on students from other UK nations studying at Welsh universities to maintain it.
The fact that the Welsh Government would subsidise students’ to study wherever they choose to do so in the UK while moving income away from Welsh universities means that Welsh universities will lose valuable resources while universities elsewhere in the UK are subsidised by the Welsh Government. This could lead to a spiral of decline in which fewer students from the UK choose to study at Welsh universities due to them being under-resourced.
Ideal System Plaid Cymru’s ideal system, based on party Policy, is one where the student contributes nothing to pay for his or her tuition – that is, a system whereby Higher Education is free to receive. As stated above, many countries in the EU have succeeded in doing this.
In order to achieve this and maintain current levels of funding for Higher Education Institutions in Wales, the Welsh Government would have to find around£336m to replace the contributions of students from the other UK nations.
This would involve diverting funding from other areas of public spending in Wales.
Cutting such large amounts would prove difficult at the present considering the cuts already imposed on devolved spending. Such cuts would be proportionally lower however if they are spread over areas of non-devolved spending as well. It stands to reason therefore that abolishing tuition fees becomes far more feasible if and when the Assembly takes control of more areas of public spending in Wales.
Subsidise only the Welsh-domiciled students who stay in Wales

23

In 2006 the Assembly decided that top up fees would not be charged to Welsh domiciled students who decide to go to university in Wales. This meant that it suddenly became roughly £2000 per year cheaper for a Welsh domiciled student to stay in Wales rather than go to England or Scotland to study.
The impact of this incentive was instant.

There was an increase of 7.2% in the number of Welsh students deciding to stay in Wales between 2005/06 and 2008/09.
With a total of 19,965 Welsh domiciled students going to university in the UK eachyear that 7.2% means that we have an extra 1,434 Welsh domiciled students studying in Wales than we would have had before the policy change.
The following table shows where students choose to work following studying in Wales and where they choose to work following studying in England.

A Welsh domiciled student who goes to university in Wales is more than twice as likely to work in Wales after graduation as a Welsh domiciled person who goes to university in England and is 4 times more likely to stay in Wales than an English domiciled student who has gone to a Welsh university.
Of the extra 1,434 students who stayed in Wales between 2005/06 and 2008/09, we can estimate that 1,276 of them will stay in Wales after graduation. That compares 24

with only 616 who would have come back if they had gone to English universities.
That means that we have 660 more Welsh graduates in Wales each year than we would have had without the incentive.
It is possible to argue that if the Welsh students had studied in England then English students would have taken their places in Wales. If this had happened then 21% of the 1,434 English students, 301, would have stayed in Wales. Even under these calculations each year we end up with 339 extra graduates staying in Wales each year.
There is plenty of evidence highlighting the benefit of HE to Wales and graduates’
overall contribution to the economy of Wales and this contribution, as the Assembly’s Enterprise and Learning Committee reported, is more significant if graduates stay in Wales.
As part of the One Wales coalition Plaid Cymru agreed to change the above system to allow Welsh universities to charge top-up fees to Welsh students. Welsh students from poorer backgrounds were offered improved bursaries to help them wherever they want to go to university.
In academic year 2012/13 the Browne report’s recommendations will be implemented by the UK Government and the cap will also be lifted in Wales. If we were to accept the lifting of the cap but to insist that Welsh domiciled students who stay in Wales get a grant to ensure they pay no more towards their tuition fees than they would have paid in academic year 2011/12 we can once again bring in an incentive for Welsh students to stay in Wales. This would benefit the Welsh economy.
In 2012, the number of Welsh-domiciled students staying in Wales to study is 16,623 and the average fee in Wales is £8,800, meaning that the total cost for Welshdomiciled students staying in Wales to study would be £146,282,400. However, the amount of students staying in Wales would probably increase if this policy was pursued.
Subsidise Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
subjects For our Future sets out the Welsh Government’s “national priorities for research match funding”. These are:





Digital economy Low carbon economy Health and biosciences Advanced engineering and manufacturing

As stated by HEFCW in its press release on reallocating student numbers in higher education, “new entrant student numbers for priority and expensive subjects will be

25

retained by universities”13 while all remaining new entrant numbers will be reallocated. One of the purposes of reallocating student numbers is to:
“Address unintended consequences of the new fees regime in Wales which, if left uncorrected, would see a disproportionate amount of funding supporting less expensive and non-priority subjects to the detriment of other priorities.”14 STEM subjects are prioritised because they are more expensive to run and because they are deemed important for the Welsh economy. It would be possible to go further and provide different levels of subsidies for students depending on what subject they are studying with greater amounts for STEM subjects and lesser amounts for other subjects.
For this approach to work we would need students to stay in Wales following graduation and as demonstrated above, students are more likely to stay in Wales if they are Welsh-domiciled on entering university and choose to study ata Welsh university.
HEFCE (the Higher Education Funding Council for England) is also prioritising STEM subjects:
“HEIs can now expect £1,500 per student for resource-intensive subjects such as science and engineering. This is equivalent to a 17% subsidy for HEIs which charge £9,000 per annum or 20% for those charging £7,500 per annum.”15 As England is also prioritising STEM subjects, Wales would be competing with England for students to study these subjects.
Another problem with this approach is that students from less advantaged backgrounds would find it more difficult to study arts and humanities subjects than STEM subjects. It would be unacceptable for studying the arts and humanities to become the privilege of the rich.
Subsidise Humanities and Arts subjects As Humanities and Arts departments face very tough times in England, many foreseeing large cutbacks and quite possibly departmental closures, a radical option open to Wales would be to capitalise on these developments in England and attempt to strengthen the Humanities and Arts in Wales.
This will involve diverting additional funding for HE from elsewhere in the block grant into the financing of HE. The additional funding can either be funnelled through the teaching grant with no particular indication that universities would 13

26

spend the funding on Humanities and Arts teaching, or an understanding with Welsh HEIs could be sought to ensure that the extra funding is on the condition that it is used to support Humanities and Arts departments. The third option would be to create a Welsh Arts and Humanities grant to HEIs.
The intention of such an approach is to begin to develop Wales as a centre of excellence in the Humanities and Arts. With the weakening of the subjects in England, Wales is well placed to take advantage of academics and students that would be squeezed out of the English system because of the cutbacks.
Such a plan would require further research to identify how much extra funding would be required in order to place Welsh Humanities and Arts departments in an advantageous position in comparison to their English counterparts.
